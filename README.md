# monero-wallet-gui-aarch64-AppleSilicon

Monero wallet Gui files, compiled on M1 Mac, for Darwin kernel, on Ventura OS.
It is quite easy to build from the original source code at https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui

I could not create an Apple dmg of just the monero-wallet-gui.app, and the file i made is nearly 500Mb, of the compiled source, which is too big for github. There is a supporting website, at https://home.mikebouckley.xyz/download/

Where the .dmg, and 2 tar archives, one of the supporting, command line tools may be downloaded from.

The monero-gui.dmg has the monero-wallet.app (and other tools) in build/release/bin/
i found that double clicking on the dmg opened the monero wallet gui.

My Server is usually availiable 24/7. Its solar powered, so occasionally OUT late at night, or for maintainance. It is a dynamic IP Address, on Fiber 50mbs. Self-signed SSL Certificate, so there is a pop-up security warning, and dialog box, view certificate, accept if you want ssl, when you get in (am working on getting LetsEncrypt Cert). Occasionally the IP Number is changed.  Hosted in Philippines.

The 10Mb. monero-wallet-gui.app is here, with longer file name, in tar.xz format.

# monero-wallet-gui-aarch64-AppleSilicon

Monero wallet Gui files, compiled on M1 Mac, for Darwin kernel, on Ventura OS, works on Monterey.

It is quite easy to build from the original source code at https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui

v0.18.1.2:
I could not yet create an Apple .dmg of just the monero-wallet-gui.app, and the file i made is nearly 500Mb, of the compiled source, which is too big for github. There is a supporting website, at https://home.mikebouckley.xyz/download/

Where the .dmg, and 2 tar archives, one of the supporting, command line tools may be downloaded from.

The monero-gui.dmg has the monero-wallet.app (and other tools) in build/release/bin/
i found that double clicking on the dmg opened the monero wallet gui.

My Server is usually availiable 24/7. Its solar powered, so occasionally OUT late at night, or for maintainance. On Fiber 100mbs. Certbot / Letsencrypt SSL Certificate. It is a dynamic IP Address, Occasionally the IP Number is changed.  Hosted in Philippines.

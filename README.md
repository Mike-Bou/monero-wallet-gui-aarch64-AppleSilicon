# monero-wallet-gui-aarch64-AppleSilicon

Monero wallet Gui files, compiled on M1 Mac, for Darwin kernel, on Ventura OS.
It is quite easy to build from the original source code at https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui

I could not create an Apple dmg of just the monero-wallet-gui.app, and the file i made is nearly 500Mb, of the compiled source, which is too big for github. There is a supporting website, at http://server.mikebouckley.xyz/download/

Where the .dmg, or 2 tar archives, one of the supporting, command line tools may be downloaded from.

The monero-gui.dmg has the monero-wallet.app (and other tools) in build/release/bin/
i found that double clicking on the dmg opened the monero wallet gui.
